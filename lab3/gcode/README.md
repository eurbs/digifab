# GCode examples

Here are some examples of gcode generated with our slicer. All of the reference stl file can be found [here](https://github.com/eurbs/digifab/tree/master/lab3/samples).

Note, there are still some wonky things, but all in all our slicer pretty much works.

All of these samples were run with the default settings.
